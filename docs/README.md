An exploration of the Julia programming language for CSCI 355

[Full Proposal](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zAACVJXP2G_ECGt8eHKT_1zGMPDgzC5JwPi9xr1OOBM)

## The Julia paradigm

Julia is not an OO language. It does not support objects per say. However, there are some leftover traits from OO programming. The main evidence of this is the subtyping feature.

One can declare a subtype of a primitive as such

```julia
primitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end
```

Julia also allows subtyping checks to evaluate to Bool values.

### Subtyping applied

Julia can uses this subtyping concept in its equivalent of C++ templates.

```julia
struct Vehicle{T}
    Type::T
    weight::Float64
    engine::String
    gun::String
end
```
One can check the subtyping of this struct as such:

Julia uses multiple dispatch, so it does not consider any concrete type to be a subtype of another concrete type.

Even though:

### Multiple Dispatch

In few words, multiple dispatch is runtime function overloading. It selects a function based on the specified type. It will select the function based on the most concrete type. It will not match subtypes with their supertype either, as you saw.

## Language features

+ Package manager

+ Build system (for packages)

+ Perl's print substitution

```julia
first="One small step for man"
last="One giant leap for mankind"
println("$first\n$last") 
```

Code Result:

+ Python's command line functionality

+ Meta Programming (Julia can access its own parser and symbols in the native language)

Parsing a string into a expression:

Constructing an expression:

+ External program execution, manipulation and interoperability:

+ Bash style variable interpolation:

+ Some matlab syntax and functions (Julia's arrays start at one)

```julia
for i in 2:2:100
    array[i] = array[i-1] + array[i]
end
```

## Train of thought

Julia's heritage of other languages leads to a interesting side effect. Juila exemplifies Perl's "There is more than one way to do it." mentality. This effect results from Julia's varing syntaxes that were imported from other programming languages. One example of this is declaring a function.

All of the following methods are equivalent.

```julia
abs(x) = (x^2)^1/2; 
```

```julia
function abs(x)
    (x^2)^(1/2)
end
```

```julia
function abs(x)
    return (x^2)^(1/2)
end
```

```julia
function abs(x); (x^2)^(1/2); end
```

The problem arises when Julia tries to buck the conventions of the languages that pulls features from. One example is that by default structs are immutable. A C programmer would not be used to that, and that would decrease writability for them since they have to make a transition to a new practice.

So far I have two examples of that. One of them is the defalut immutable struct, and the other is having to re-declare a global variable inside a local scope to acess that variable. While these might seem like minor nuances, they indicate that the Julia team is willing to depart from convention in ways that might not be helpful.

## Gripes and Nitpicks

### Incomplete support

The language does not universally support all of its features across all cases or scenarios.

One example is global variable typing.

```julia
global_var::Float32 = 34.5134
```

This results in:

### "Features"

#### Scope specification

The scope in julia has a unique mechanic involved in it. This design choice can be good for clarity, but it only if you know what it means. Here is an example.

```julia
bestpos = 0.0
bestfit = -1000000.0

# change in scope
for i in 1:1:100
    global bestfit  # YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. WHY?

    for j in 1:100
        if(stuff[j] > bestfit)
            bestfit = stuff[j];
        end
    end   

    # do the rest of your stuff
end
```
If you omitted that `global bestfit` statement, you would encounter this error:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aklapatch/explore-julia/master/images/juliaGlobalError.png)

To access the global variables you declared earlier, you need to specify that they want to access that variable. The problem is that that the scope specification, this statement:
```julia
global bestfit
``` 
looks like a variable declaration. This could be confusing and decreases readability if you do not know what it is. 

In my opinion, there is a universal, better solution. One could use descriptive variable names.
```julia
global_var_name = value
``` 

This is a glaring issue because other languages do not have this "feature" and are fine without it. Julia could be made simpler without a significant consequence by omitting this feature.

#### Mutable structs

This how you declare an immutable struct:
```julia
struct fubar
    foxtrot::Int64
    uniform::UInt32
    bravo::Int8
end
```

This is how you declare a mutable struct:
```julia
mutable struct person
    age::Int8
    beliefs::String
end
```

This bucks the C convention, and if you are going to inherit from C, it is not a good principle to buck its convention. This makes it harder to transition from C to Juila.

It would be more C like to have an immutable struct declared as follows:

```julia
immutable struct example
    var1
    var2
end
```
