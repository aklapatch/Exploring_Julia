An exploration of the Julia programming language for CSCI 355

[Full Proposal](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zAACVJXP2G_ECGt8eHKT_1zGMPDgzC5JwPi9xr1OOBM)

## Progress

So far I am playing with the language and following the beginner's documentation to get some knowlegde of the language and its features.

### Language features so far

 + Package manager

 + Build system

 + Perl's print substitution

```julia
first="One small step for man"
last="One giant leap for mankind"
println("$first\n$last")
```
Code Result:

 + Python's command line functionality

### Train of thought

Julia's heritage of other languages leads to a interesting side effect. Juila exemplifies Perl's "There is more than one way to do it." mentality. This effect results from Julia's varing syntaxes that were imported from other programming languages. One example of this is declaring a function.

All of the following methods are equivalent.

```julia
abs(x) = (x^2)^1/2; 
```

```julia
function abs(x)
    (x^2)^(1/2)
end
```

```julia
function abs(x)
    return (x^2)^(1/2)
end
```

```julia
function abs(x); (x^2)^(1/2); end
```
