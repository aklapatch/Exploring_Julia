# Main attributes

## Static or Dynamic compliation?

Julia is an interpreted language: compiled then run around the same time. Because the Julia interpreter tries to optimize the code more than other scripting languages, initial compilation may take longer than other scripting languages.

### Compilation exceptions

Julia code can be embedded in C code, linked to the julia library, and compiled with gcc. In addition, there is a Julia package called [PackageCompiler](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl) that helps automate this process. However, this process can take an unusually long time.

## Pass by Value?

Julia is pass by value as long as you are passing in a single primitive. values inside arrays and structs can be mutated, but structs and arrays cannot be reassigned to the input parameter. It is most similar to Java's pass by a copy of an object's reference.

A quick example:
```julia
mutable struct TestType
    var
end

function test(var)
    var = 3
    return
end

function structTest(input::TestType)
    input.var = 3
    return
end
# init member variable to 4
test_struct = TestType(4)
println("Before structTest $(test_struct.var)")

structTest(test_struct) # alter test_struct.var
println("After structTest $(test_struct.var)")

input_arg = 42
println("Before test $input_arg")

test(input_arg) # this will not change input_arg
println("After test $input_arg")
```
That code outputs:

## Type checking 

Julia checks types at runtime. It can use the argument's types to determine which function should be called.

```julia
function f(x::Int,y::Int)
    # do integer stuff
end

function f(x,y)
    # do stuff
end
```

In this example the first version of the function `f` will be called if the arguments are integers, and the second function will be called if the arguments are not an integer or an integer subtype. Specifying argument types should be done where possible to increase performance.

## Exception handling

Julia has a lot of builtin exceptions. Some examples of those exceptions follow:
```julia
ArgumentError
DomainError
OverflowError
BoundsError
OutOfMemoryError
```

Exceptions can be declared and defined as such:
```julia
struct SpecialException <: Exception end
```
The `<:` symbol indicates a subtype. In this case it means that `SpecialException` is a subtype or type of Exception.

Exceptions  are triggered by using the `throw` keyword:
```julia
throw(OutOfMemoryError())
```

Julia uses try catch and finally blocks to handle exceptions:
```julia
try
    # try to do something

catch
    # do if an exception occurs

finally
    # this executes whether or
    # not an exception occurrs
end
```

## Memory management

Memory is  managed automatically, like most scripting languages.

# Julia's features

+ Package manager

+ Build system (for packages)

+ Perl's print substitution

```julia
first="One small step for man"
last="One giant leap for mankind"
println("$first\n$last")
```

Code Result:

# The Julia paradigm

Julia is not an object oriented programming language. However, there are some leftover traits from the object oriented programming paradigm. Those leftovers are Julia's subtyping and abstraction.

Julia's abstraction takes place through abstract types. For example:
```julia
abstract type Language end

struct English <: Language end

struct Spanish <: Language end
```
Now `English` and `Spanish` are subtypes of Languages and both of them can used in functions with the `Language` abstract type.

One could even make subtypes of a primtive. You can declare a subtype of a primitive like this:

```julia
primitive type Bool <: Integer 8 end
```

Julia also allows subtyping checks to evaluate to Bool values.

## Subtyping applied

Julia can uses this subtyping concept in its equivalent of C++ templates.

```julia
struct Vehicle{T}
    Type::T
    weight::Float64
    engine::String
    gun::String
end
```
One can check the subtyping of this struct as such:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aklapatch/explore-julia/master/images/subtypeStruct.PNG)

Julia uses multiple dispatch, so it does not consider any concrete type to be a subtype of another concrete type.

Even though:

## Multiple Dispatch

In few words, multiple dispatch is runtime function overloading.

In more words, it selects a function at runtime based on the types of the arguments. If the argument is a supertype or abstract type, it will accept all subtypes of that supertype.
```julia
function test(y::Real)
    if (y>20)
        return 1
    else
        return 0
    end
end

function main()
    t::Float32 = 34.34234
    x::Float64 = 34.34234
    
    println("val= ",test(t))
    println("val= ",test(x))
end

main()
```

Running that yields this result:

### Why Multiple Dispatch? (Why no objects?)

The main reasons I have found are simplicity and ease of extending existing code.

The most common example of this is implementing functions that could, in an object-oriented language, be bound to two different objects. 

One possible situation that exemplifies this is simulating a person starting a car. In Julia that function could look like this:
```julia
function startCar(input_person::Person, input_car::Car)
    start!(input_car)
end
```

Following an object oriented programming style, Java in this case, would have a function prototype like this

```java
public class Person {

    void startCar(Car input_car){
        input_car.start();
    }
}
```
In Julia, functions cannot not bound to an object like Java or C++. The main disadvantage of that is the lack of access control (e.g. public and private functions) and the lack of inheritance. 

Multiple dispatch makes up for the inheritance deficiency by allowing the user to redefine fuctions with abstract arguments for more concrete types. This approach is simpler than object oriented programming since it does not have the additional behavior of objects stacked on top of structs and methods.

# What I noticed

Julia's heritage of other languages leads to a interesting side effect. Juila exemplifies Perl's "There is more than one way to do it." mentality. This effect results from Julia's varing syntaxes that were imported from other programming languages. One example of this is declaring a function.

All of the following methods are equivalent.

```julia
abs(x) = (x^2)^1/2;
```

```julia
function abs(x)
    (x^2)^(1/2)
end
```

```julia
function abs(x)
    return (x^2)^(1/2)
end
```

```julia
function abs(x); (x^2)^(1/2); end
```
# Gripes and Nitpicks

## Incomplete support

The language does not universally support all of its features across all cases or scenarios.

One example is global variable typing.

```julia
global_var::Float32 = 34.5134
```

This results in:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aklapatch/explore-julia/master/images/typingGlobalVars.png)

## Scope specification

The scope in julia has a unique mechanic involved in it. This design choice can be good for clarity, but it only if you know what it means. Here is an example.

```julia
bestpos = 0.0
bestfit = -1000000.0

# change in scope
for i in 1:1:100
    global bestfit  # YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. WHY?

    for j in 1:100
        if(stuff[j] > bestfit)
            bestfit = stuff[j];
        end
    end

    # do the rest of your stuff
end
```
If you omitted that `global bestfit` statement, you would encounter this error:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aklapatch/explore-julia/master/images/juliaGlobalError.png)

To access the global variables you declared earlier, you need to specify that they want to access that variable. The problem is that that the scope specification, the statement
```global bestfit``` 
looks like a variable declaration. This could be confusing and decreases readability if you do not know what it is. Other languages do not have this "feature" and are fine without it. Julia could be made simpler without a significant consequence by omitting this feature.

## Breaking conventions

This how you declare an immutable struct:
```julia
struct fubar
    foxtrot::Int64
    uniform::UInt32
    bravo::Int8
end
```

This is how you declare a mutable struct:
```julia
mutable struct person
    age::UInt8
    beliefs::String
end
```

This bucks the C convention, and if you are going to inherit from C, it is not a good principle to buck its convention. This makes it harder to transition from C to Juila.

It would be more C like to have an immutable struct declared as follows:

```julia
immutable struct example
    var1
    var2
end
```
